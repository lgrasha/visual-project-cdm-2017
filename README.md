# visual-project-cdm-2017
I HAVE FINALLY FIGURED OUT AN IDEA!!! :D
Per my original confusion on how to operate GitHub and GIMP, I have resolved it. The mystery of the tools is revealing itself to me. As my working knowledge of the two programs improves, the process of creating a composite image becomes easier. And not as infuriating.
Oddly enough, ideating this visual project seems at times more trying than creating some proposals. But that's likely because I'm fitting ideas into a new medium. I expect that personal usability to affect my efficacy in making the program do what I want it to.
Either way, the idea I generated was to take a German ballot image and use that as a template to "vote" on initiatives which affect treatment of refugees. It alludes to dystopian fiction, which may reflect an incidental audience/message goal. I want to keep with the format I've discovered. Playing with a standard ballot format with more graphic images of refugees creates a thematic contrast.
