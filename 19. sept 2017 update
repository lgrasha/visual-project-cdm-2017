The current standing of my draft hasn't changed over the weekend (shocker). However, I plan to fiddle around with fonts and other content changes. I need to make more progress on my project, since no changes have been made since the last time I submitted a draft. And here, I'll revisit criteria, per the exercise after workshopping on the 19th:
</p>
I personally aspire to create something that speaks shockingly to the refugee crisis. Oddly, whenever I think on introducing German politics and social issues to my American peers, I constantly return to this crisis. It takes harbor in my thoughts. i hope to display this crisis in a dystopian manner to portray the gruesome reality that occurred during these mass-displacements of people. These haven't changed over the weekend.

The baseline criteria establish...an appropriate baseline. I have no qualms with them. They're easy to follow.
<p>
Per the aspirational criteria, I think they provide a proper opening into which students can fling their ideas. If idea-flinging aligns with aspirations, that is.

Altogether, I find that my draft sits in an appropriate place. However, I need to finalize details and clean up the ballot. It'll get done.
